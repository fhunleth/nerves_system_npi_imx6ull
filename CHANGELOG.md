## v0.3.1

This is a security/bug fix release that updates to Buildroot 2021.02.1 and OTP
23.3.1. It should be safe for everyone to apply.

  * [nerves_system_br v1.15.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.15.1)
  * [Buildroot 2021.02](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-April/307970.html)

## v0.3.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.02 and OTP 23.2.7. If you have made a
custom system off this one, please review the `nerves_system_br v1.15.0` release
notes.

The Nerves toolchain has also been updated to v1.4.2. This brings in Linux 4.14
headers to enable use of cdev and eBPF. This won't affect most users.

    GPIO headers work more like the Raspberry Pi by default
  * Synchronize with official systems

## v0.1.0

This is the initial release. The basics work: MicroSD boot, Linux, both Ethernet
ports, the RTC, DT overlays, firmware updates. The display and eMMC support are
untested and likely require work. Only a cursory skim of power management and
other peripherals has been made so far.
