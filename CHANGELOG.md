# Changelog

This project does NOT follow semantic versioning. The version increases as
follows:

1. Major version updates are breaking updates to the build infrastructure.
   These should be very rare.
2. Minor version updates are made for every major Buildroot release. This
   may also include Erlang/OTP and Linux kernel updates. These are made four
   times a year shortly after the Buildroot releases.
3. Patch version updates are made for Buildroot minor releases, Erlang/OTP
   releases, and Linux kernel updates. They're also made to fix bugs and add
   features to the build infrastructure.

an easy update for most projects, many programs have been updated. Please review
the changes in the updated dependencies for details.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.19.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.19.0)
  * [Buildroot 2022.02.1](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2022-April/640712.html). Also see [Buildroot 2022.02](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2022-March/638160.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 25.0](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-25.0.README)

## v0.6.5

* Changes

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.18.6](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.18.6)

## v0.6.4

This is a Buildroot and Erlang bug and security fix release. It should be a low
risk upgrade from the previous release.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.18.5](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.18.5)

## v0.6.3

This is a Buildroot and Erlang bug fix release. It should be a low risk upgrade
from the previous release.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.18.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.18.4)

* Changes
  * Specify CPU-specific flags when compiling NIFs and ports. This fixes an
    issue where some optimizations could not be enabled in NIFs even though it
    should be possible to have them. E.g., ARM NEON support for CPUs that have
    it.
  * Build the Wireguard kernel driver. This is a small device driver that
    enables a number of VPN-based use cases.

## v0.6.2

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.18.3](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.18.3)

* Changes
  * Programs that use OpenMP will run now. The OpenMP shared library
    (`libgomp.so`) was supplied by the toolchain, but not copied.

## v0.6.1

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.11 and OTP 24.2. If you have made a
custom system, please review the `nerves_system_br` [release
notes](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/blob/v1.18.2/CHANGELOG.md#v1180).

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.18.2](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.18.2)
  * [Buildroot 2021.11](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-December/629911.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.2](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.2.README)
  * GCC 10.3

* Improvements
  * Support for the `dl.nerves-project.org` backup site. Due to a GitHub outage
    in November, there was a 2 day period of failing builds since some packages
    could not be downloaded. We implemented the backup site to prevent this in
    the future. This update is in the `nerves_defconfig`.
  * Use new build ORB on CircleCI. This ORB will shorten build times to fit in
    CircleCI's new free tier limits. Please update if building your own systems.

## v0.6.0

Use v0.6.1 instead.

## v0.5.4

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.17.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.17.4)
  * [Buildroot 2021.08.2](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-November/628323.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.1.7](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.1.7.README).

## v0.5.3

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.17.3](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.17.3)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.1.4](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.1.4.README).

## v0.5.2

This is a security/bug fix patch release. It should be safe to update for
everyone.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.17.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.17.1)
  * [Buildroot 2021.08.1](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-October/625642.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.1.2](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.1.2.README)

* Improvements
  * Include software versioning and licensing info (see legal-info directory in
    artifact)

## v0.5.1

This fixes a regression that happened when the toolchain was updated to require
Linux kernel headers newer than the kernel used in this project. Rather than
holding the kernel version back, I updated it to Linux 5.10. This is beyond what
Seeed supports (4.19), but it's 2021 and Linux 5.10 appears to work well.

* Updated dependencies
  * Linux 5.10.59

## v0.5.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.08 and OTP 24.1. If you have made a
custom system off this one, please review the `nerves_system_br v1.17.0` release
notes.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.17.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.17.0)
  * [Buildroot 2021.08](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-September/622072.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.1](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.1.README)

## v0.4.2

This release updates Erlang/OTP from 24.0.3 to 24.0.5 and Buildroot from 2021.05
to 2021.05.1. Both of these are security/bug fix updates. This is expected to be
a safe upgrade from v1.16.1 for all users.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.16.4](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.16.1)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.0.5](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0.5.README)

* Improvements
  * Beta support for using a `runtime.exs` script for runtime configuration.
  * Added a `provision` task to the `fwup.config` to enable re-provisioning a
    MicroSD card without changing its contents.
  * Adds a default `/etc/sysctl.conf` that enables use of ICMP in Erlang. This
    requires `nerves_runtime v0.11.5` or later to automatically load the sysctl
    variables. With it using `:gen_udp` to send/receive ICMP will "just work".
    It also makes it easier to add other sysctl variables if needed.

## v0.4.1

This release updates Nerves Toolchains to v1.4.3 and OTP 24.0.3. It should be
safe for everyone to apply.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.16.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.16.1)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.0.3](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0.3.README)
  * [nerves toolchains v1.4.3](https://github.com/nerves-project/toolchains/releases/tag/v1.4.3)

## v0.4.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.05 and OTP 24.0.2. If you have made a
custom system off this one, please review the `nerves_system_br v1.16.0` release
notes.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.16.0](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.16.0)
  * [Buildroot 2021.05](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-June/311946.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 24.0.2](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-24.0.2.README)

* Improvements
  * This release now contains debug symbols and includes the Build-ID in the
    ELF headers. This makes it easier to get stack traces from C programs. As
    before, the Nerves tooling strips all symbols from firmware images, so this
    won't make programs bigger.

## v0.3.1

This is a security/bug fix release that updates to Buildroot 2021.02.1 and OTP
23.3.1. It should be safe for everyone to apply.

* Updated dependencies
  * [nerves_system_br v1.15.1](https://github.com/nerves-project/nerves_system_br/releases/tag/v1.15.1)
  * [Buildroot 2021.02](http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2021-April/307970.html)
  * [Erlang/OTP 23.3.1](https://erlang.org/download/OTP-23.3.1.README)

## v0.3.0

This release updates to Buildroot 2021.02 and OTP 23.2.7. If you have made a
custom system off this one, please review the `nerves_system_br v1.15.0` release
notes.

The Nerves toolchain has also been updated to v1.4.2. This brings in Linux 4.14
headers to enable use of cdev and eBPF. This won't affect most users.

* Updated dependencies

This updates the system to the `nerves_system_br 1.14.x` series and updates the

## v0.1.0

This is the initial release. The basics work: MicroSD boot, Linux, both Ethernet
ports, the RTC, DT overlays, firmware updates. The display and eMMC support are
untested and likely require work. Only a cursory skim of power management and
other peripherals has been made so far.
