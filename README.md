This is the base Nerves System configuration for the [NPi
i.MX6ULL](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/seeed-technology-co-ltd/102991306/1597-102991306-ND/10492211).

## Using

This port currently only runs off a MicroSD card. It has not been updated to
support eMMC usage. If you're interested, please see
[#1](https://github.com/fhunleth/nerves_system_npi_imx6ull/issues/1). Because of
this, you'll need to modify the boot select switches to `SD` boot (It's
`01001001`, but see legend on PCB)

The most common way of using this Nerves System is create a project with `mix
nerves.new` and add `npi_imx6ull` references where needed and in a similar way
to the default systems like `bbb`, etc. Then export `MIX_TARGET=npi_imx6ull`.
See the [Getting started
guide](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/getting-started.html#creating-a-new-nerves-app)
for more information.

If you need custom modifications to this system for your device, clone this
repository and update as described in [Making custom
systems](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/customizing-systems.html).

## Console access

The console is configured to output to the 4-pin white header near the power
connectors. A 3.3V FTDI cable is needed to access the output.

In theory, the console could be routed to the display. The display hasn't been
enabled. See
[#2](https://github.com/fhunleth/nerves_system_npi_imx6ull/issues/2).

If you would like console access via the LCD, you will need to enable LCD
support in the Linux kernel, and change `erlinit.conf` to output to `tty1`.

## Networking

The board has two 100 Mbps Ethernet interfaces. Here's an example `:vintage_net`
configuration that enables both of them:

```elixir
config :vintage_net,
  config: [
    {"eth0",
     %{
       type: VintageNetEthernet,
       ipv4: %{method: :dhcp}
     }},
    {"eth1",
     %{
       type: VintageNetEthernet,
       ipv4: %{method: :dhcp}
     }}
  ]
```

The USB C connector provides a virtual Ethernet connection making it possible to
both power and connect to the board using one cable. This is enabled in
`:vintage_net` by adding a `"usb0"` entry to the network config:

```elixir
config :vintage_net,
  config: [
    {"usb0", %{type: VintageNetDirect}}
  ]
```

You can combine the two configs and have three network interfaces or add a USB
WiFi dongle for a fourth one. If adding a WiFi dongle, though, you'll need to
enable the kernel drivers and add the firmware for it to a custom image.

## Linux and U-Boot versions

The NPi i.MX6ULL vary by kernel version and patch set. Nerves tracks those
maintained by Robert Nelson at
[eewiki.net](https://www.digikey.com/eewiki/display/linuxonarm/NPi+i.MX6ULL)

Nerves also integrates the NPi i.MX6ULL's U-boot patches but modifies them to
support the Nerves U-Boot environment variables.
